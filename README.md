# SQL: Employee Tracker (Mod-12-Challenge)

## Description

SQL: Employee Tracker, or Module 12's Challenge, is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee databased and act as a content management system (CMS). As business owner, they should be able to view and manage the departments, roles and employees in their company. Specifically, they should be able to view all departments (department name/id), all roles (title/salary/id/department), and all employees (first name/last name/id/title/department/salary/manager), as well as add a depertment, a role and an employee, and update an employee.  This challenge will test our ability to utilize the Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Installation

Create new repository and begin code from scratch. Set up .gitignore, package.json (inquirer, MySQL2, dotenv, cfonts), and .env. Add additional javascript files needed such as server.js and questions.js, and sql files such as schema.sql and seeds.sql. Installation also includes an npm install for programs in package.json (creates package-lock.json and node_modules) and "source schema.sql" to created database and pull in seed.sql data. Installation also includes previously installed node.js as well as to begin command-line questions.
